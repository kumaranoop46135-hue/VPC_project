# ☁️ AWS VPC Complete Setup with Public & Private Subnet

## 📖 Introduction
In this project, I explain how to create a **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** in AWS step by step.  
VPC helps us create a secure private network in the cloud where we can launch EC2 instances, create subnets, configure internet gateways, route tables, and more.

This project demonstrates basic cloud networking concepts used in real-world DevOps environments.

## 🌐 What is VPC?

A **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** is a private network inside AWS.  
It is like our own personal network where we can securely deploy cloud resources.

Inside a VPC we can create:

- Private Subnet  
- Route Tables
